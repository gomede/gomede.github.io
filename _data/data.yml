codes:
    title: Open Source Codes
    intro: >
      Some selected open-source code.

    assignments:
      - title: Predicting Stock Market Returns
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Predicting_Stock_Market_Returns.html"
        tagline: Stock market trading is an application domain with a large potential for data mining. In effect, the existence of an enormous amount of historical data suggests that data mining can provide a competitive advantage over human inspection of these data.
    
      - title: Particle Swarm Optimization
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Particle_Swarm_Optimization.html"
        tagline: Swarm intelligence is a branch of artificial intelligence that studies the collective behavior and emergent properties of complex, self-organized, decentralized systems with social structure. Such systems consist of simple interacting agents organized in small societies, or swarms.

      - title: Hypothesis Testing
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Hypothesis_Testing.html"
        tagline: Point estimates and confidence intervals are basic inference tools that act as the foundation for another inference technique statistical hypothesis testing. Statistical hypothesis testing is a framework for determining whether observed data deviates from what is expected.

      - title: Singular Value Decomposition 
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/How_to_Calculate_the_SVD_from_Scratch_with_Python.html"
        tagline: Perhaps the most known and widely used matrix decomposition method is the Singular-Value Decomposition, or SVD. All matrices have an SVD, which makes it more stable than other methods, such as the eigendecomposition. As such, it is often used in a wide array of applications including compressing, denoising, and data reduction.

      - title: Principal Component Analysis
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Principal_Component_Analysis.html"
        tagline: Principal Component Analysis is basically a statistical procedure to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables.

      - title: Simulating a Turing Machine
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Turing_Machine.html"
        tagline: A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite the model's simplicity, given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.

      - title: Interpreting Simple Linear Model
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Simple_Linear_Model.html"
        tagline: Linear regression models are a key part of the family of supervised learning models. In particular, linear regression models are a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response. For more details, check an article I’ve written on Simple Linear Regression - An example using R. In general, statistical softwares have different ways to show a model output.

      - title: Principal Component Methods in R Practical Guide
        link: "https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/gomede/machine.learning/blob/main/Principal_Component_Methods_in_R_Practical_Guide.html"
        tagline: Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss.
